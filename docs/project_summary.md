# Athlete Dashboard - Project Summary

## Project Overview
The Athlete Dashboard is a modern web application designed for endurance athletes, particularly runners, that provides comprehensive training analytics and AI-powered coaching advice. The application allows users to upload training data from devices like Garmin watches (in `.fit` format), automatically analyzes sessions using scientific training load metrics, visualizes the data with interactive charts, and provides personalized coaching advice.

## Completed Features

### Database Schema
- Designed a comprehensive Supabase schema with tables for:
  - Users and profiles
  - Workouts and workout metrics
  - Training load calculations
  - GPS data
  - User settings
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data privacy

### FIT File Processing
- Implemented file upload functionality using Supabase Storage
- Created a parser service using the fit-file-parser library
- Extracted key metrics including duration, distance, heart rate, cadence, elevation, pace, and GPS coordinates
- Stored parsed data in the appropriate database tables

### Training Metrics Calculation
- Implemented scientific training metrics:
  - TRIMP (Training Impulse) using Banister's formula
  - ATL (Acute Training Load) with 7-day time constant
  - CTL (Chronic Training Load) with 42-day time constant
  - TSB (Training Stress Balance)
  - VO2max estimation
  - HR Drift calculation
- Created utility functions for all metrics

### Dashboard UI
- Designed a responsive dashboard layout with three main sections:
  - Left sidebar for workout list and file upload
  - Main content area for charts and workout details
  - Right sidebar for AI Smart Coach panel
- Implemented interactive charts using Recharts:
  - Training Load Chart (ATL/CTL/TSB)
  - Weekly Mileage Chart
  - HR Zones Chart
  - TRIMP Session Chart
- Created workout list and detail components

### AI Smart Coach
- Integrated with OpenAI API for generating personalized coaching advice
- Designed comprehensive prompts for workout analysis
- Created a serverless function for secure API integration
- Implemented a user-friendly Coach Panel UI component

### User Authentication
- Implemented email-based authentication using Supabase Auth
- Created sign-up and sign-in flows
- Added profile management functionality
- Secured routes with authentication checks

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - Project requirements and specifications
  - Database schema design
  - FIT file parsing implementation
  - Training metrics calculations and formulas
  - Deployment guide for Vercel
  - User guide with feature explanations

### Future Features Research
- Researched additional features from popular platforms:
  - Runalyze: Recovery advisor, Training effect, Shoe tracking, Weather impact, Race prediction
  - Strava: Relative Effort scoring, Segment comparison
  - Garmin Connect: Stress score, Daily recommendations, HRV-based readiness, Sleep/Recovery influence
- Prioritized features for future development phases

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React with React Router
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- AI Integration: OpenAI API via serverless function
- Deployment: Vercel
- Charts: Recharts
- Maps: (Prepared for Leaflet.js integration in Phase 2)

## Next Steps
The MVP is now complete and ready for deployment. Future development phases will focus on:

### Phase 2
- Add map route display with Leaflet.js
- Implement workout comparison view
- Add manual workout entry form
- Add VO2max trend and estimated race times
- Implement shoe tracking

### Phase 3
- Develop AI-generated training plans
- Create AI race preparation module
- Implement custom HR zones per user
- Enhance the AI coach with personality and more personalized advice

## Conclusion
The Athlete Dashboard MVP provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive training analytics platform. With its scientific approach to training metrics, user-friendly interface, and AI-powered coaching, it offers significant value to both recreational and performance-focused runners. The modular architecture and well-documented codebase will facilitate future development and feature additions.
