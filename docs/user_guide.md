## Understanding Your Metrics

### Basic Metrics

Each workout displays basic metrics including:
- Duration
- Distance
- Average pace
- Average heart rate
- Maximum heart rate
- Elevation gain

### Advanced Training Metrics

The dashboard calculates several advanced metrics:

#### TRIMP (Training Impulse)
- Measures the training load of a workout based on heart rate and duration
- Higher values indicate more intense workouts

#### ATL (Acute Training Load)
- Represents your short-term training load over the past 7 days
- Responds quickly to recent workouts

#### CTL (Chronic Training Load)
- Represents your long-term training load over the past 42 days
- Changes more slowly and indicates your fitness level

#### TSB (Training Stress Balance)
- The difference between CTL and ATL
- Positive values indicate freshness, negative values indicate fatigue

#### VO2max Estimate
- An estimate of your maximum oxygen uptake
- Higher values indicate better aerobic fitness

#### HR Drift
- Measures the increase in heart rate relative to pace during a workout
- Lower values indicate better cardiovascular efficiency

## Using the Charts

### Training Load Chart
- Displays ATL, CTL, and TSB over time
- Helps visualize fitness trends and identify potential overtraining

### Weekly Mileage Chart
